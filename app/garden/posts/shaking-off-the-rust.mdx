summary: "I started learning Rust again"
---

I have picked up the Rust programming language book again (for I think a third time) and have been enjoying myself.
I've mostly been reading it, writing the examples out and testing different things in the early mornings before
starting my actual work. 30 min a day has been the goal so far and I've been sticking to it for most days during the week
(not on weekends, because I refuse to do anything coding related during that time, yay for burnout!)

Why did I pick Rust those 3 years ago? It was gaining popularity and a lot of the JS folks were jumping on it,
building tools and even runtimes. I wanted to see what the hype was about and what made it so appealing. Having
never programmed in a lower level language I was a bit scared to not understand it enough to be productive.
What I found has been a lovely experience that has made me want to learn another language, especially the
excellent Rust book along with the Rustlings project.

Do I need the language for every day work? No.

Do I like taking the time to learn something new that is completely out of my zone of every day work? Yes.

I'm at chapter 6 currently and should go back to reading as I want to learn what Enums are, bye.
