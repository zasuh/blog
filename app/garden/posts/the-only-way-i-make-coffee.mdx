I started regularly drinking coffee when I was finishing high school. The amount
of studying I had to do to finish my matura (final exams) was immense and that's
when I began my mornings with a nice cup of zoom zoom juice. Back then I was drinking
instant Nescaffee coffee because that's all we had at home and my parents drank it
every day (still do, they should really stop). You would put it 1-2 small spoons
of the stuff, heat up the water in your kettle, pour it over, add milk/sugar and
were good to go.

I drank coffee like that for years, well into my college days where I also regularly
started drinking it at coffee shops, not instant coffee of course, but espresso, with milk
(ew). And so it went on for about 8 years I think.

After moving in with my girlfriend I switched to drink what we call turkish style coffee.
You boil water, put the ground up coffee in it and then depending who you ask have a very specific
way of making it. I would put the coffee in the water, then slowly whisk it with a spoon so it
would gently fall in the water. If you did it too quickly it would react to the hotness of the water
and a small coffee volcano would start pouring out, leaving you with no coffee and a mess to clean up.

For a couple of years that was our primary coffee drinking habit of choice, but slowly I would develop
some stomach pain drinking it due to all the resedue that would still float in it.

One year when we were exchanging christmas gifts, my girlfriend's dad gave us some irish cream
scended espresso coffee intended to be used in moka pots. That smell alone makes me want to wake up
in the morning these days. Needless to say we were hooked and immediately bought a much larger
moka pot for our morning brews which we still use today. It's part of our ritual. I get up earlier,
clear the pot from the day before, heat up the water in a kettle (this is important), pour the water
in the moka cup, put the filter on, put coffee in the filter all the way to the top, screw the top
part on and set the fire to low (also extremely important). After it starts gushing out I turn off
the fire, give it a bit to settle and pour, with a bit of sugar, no milk.

Mornings where I drink coffee from a moka pot are always good.
