I suck at web design. Even though I'm primarily a frontend developer and have an
eye for UX/UI, it's more towards functionality rather than original and well made
design. While looking at other people's blogs I'm jealous at what people think of
and make from their own sites and fuck I want that too.

So I stole the colour palette and rough design from [anhvn's blog](https://anhvn.com/blog/),
thank you Anh, I really love your site and I hope you don't mind me taking some of your
design for myself <3.
