Starting your own personal website, styling it the way you want
and publishing whatever you feel like it is probably the most freeing thing I've done in a while.

---

This was largely inspired by reading blogs such as Ludicity and then stumbling across multiple
personal websites where people were doing original things with design, pages, illustrations and writings.
I want to be a part of that and so consider this my first note/post declaring that I have a personal site.

---

It will be a work in progress, like other things, but most importantly it needs to be published. Without
publishing this work it isn't real in my opinion. I still need to setup a domain and hosting, but I will get to that.
For now I just want to write about anything that comes to mind.

I think I might be separating the garden into 2 sections where one hosts toot like shorter notes about whatever is happening.
And the other hosts more longer form content. For now everything will live in here.

I should also start using Mastodon...
