## Work

On my first solo professional full-stack project. Using NextJS, shadcn, Tailwind, Supabase which comes from MakerKit.
I'm learning a lot about the tech stack and the business side of things while trying to maintain stress levels low.

## Magic

Playing mostly cEDH every Tuesday (Competitive EDH) and casual EDH with my girlfriend/close friends.
When I have the energy and will I open up MTG Arena for some limited after a new set drops.

## Watching

[Up to date Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/znsh/). Recent favourite was Perfect Days and I saw Kiki's Delivery Service for the first time.
Two calming movies for the start of the new year.

## Reading

Re-reading Meditations by Marcus Aurelius as it has been a while since I last read it. Simultaneously reading Code Complete 2 by Steve McConnell
which is behemoth of a book and might take me the whole year to finish given my current schedule.

## Listening

Mostly podcasts and audiobooks. Podcast include Shop Talk Show, Stoic Coffee Break, Hardcore History and Slovenian show called [Opazovalnica](https://https://apparatus.si/oddaja/opazovalnica/).
Audiobook focus has been on The Stormlight Archive by Brandon Sanderson.

## Plans

Mostly in order of importance:

- Not stressing out about work.
- Exercise.
- Planning our big trip in April.
- Saving money.
- Learning.
- Writing.
- Reading.
- Friends.
- Magic.
